irrigation that could be used to water plants with a common water bottle. My partner and I took
measurements of the water bottle and used those to base our 3D model on in Fusion 360. We made
multiple versions before creating one that (mostly) works. This week, we also had to think of and
create an object that could be made additively but not subtractively. I created a hollow object
with a cube on the inside.</h2>
