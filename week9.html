computing. This is a process of using code and physical hardware (in this case Raspberry Pi) to
create something that can respond to the real-world. In my experience, Raspberry Pi seems like a
relatively easy piece of equipment to use, although there does appear to be a learning curve. The
most difficult part of physical computing is making sure your code is correct and consistent. This
can be made easier by using programs such as Python and Scratch to program the device. These take
away the need to be a fluent coder and allow the user to focus on what they would like the code to
do. My favorite Raspberry Pi activity was coding the traffic light. I liked this specifically because
it posed a challenge having to time the lights with sleep commands and was satisfying when I finally
was able to make it work the way I wanted it to.</h2>
