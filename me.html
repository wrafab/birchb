at Western Reserve Academy. I am a day student, and live in Bath, Ohio. When selecting
classes this summer, I was unsure of which art class I would take. After seeing Digital
Engineering and Fabrication on the list, I was immediately interested. Before this year,
I had been to the Wang Innovation Center only a few times and always wished I knew how
to use the wide assorment of machines in the space. Because of this I decided to try
something new and sign up for this class.</h2>
